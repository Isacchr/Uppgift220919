Created some exercises for a school project. Used Html, css and java Script.

First two input are meant to calculate a prime number. If you put in 5 in the first input you will get the fifth prime number and
if you put 5 in the second input you get the first 5 prime numbers.

The second two input are about the fibonacci sequence. If you put 5 in the first input you get the fifth number in the fibonacci sequence and
if you put 5 in the second input you will get the first 5 numbers in the fibonacci sequence.

In the future you could refactor the code to use other loops then a for loop, maybe a foreach loop? In the fibonacci inputs you cold probably use other loops
for the functions instead of 2 if statements and one for loop. Had problem when i wrote numbers under 3 in fibonacci sequnce and therefore i used multiply if statements.
